Shiv can be charming to the right people, but Kendall seems like the kinda person that can adapt well in different social settings in order to get along with the people around him. Whereas Shiv and Connor struggle outside of their comfort zones. And Roman appears to just not even have a comfort zone and is completely socially inept.\n",
