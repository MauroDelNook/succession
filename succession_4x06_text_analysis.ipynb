            "Comment: My previous tech company started every quarterly meeting off with a badly produced cringe rap they'd written in house. (Not putting down the production team, they were just doing what they were hired to do. Every company has a Kendall Roy barking orders and wasting time - sigh.) It was so, so bad and it's somehow made worse that people in the audience cheer and others put comments in the zoom feed like \"LOVE the vibes!\", \"AMAZING RAP HAHA!\" and you want to kick yourself in the teeth\n",
